# RacelineOptimizer

This is the PSO algoritm for raceline optimization.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (version 6.0 or later) - To run C#

## How to Run

1. **CD to this directory** (if you haven't already):

    ```bash
    cd Backend/RacelineOptimizer
    ```

2. **Restore dependencies**:

    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    ```

3. **Prepare the project**:

    - Create a folder to take input.
        ```bash
        mkdir Input
        ```
    - Place .bin file(s) generated by the image generator in the Input folder.

4. **Run the project**:

    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

    - Select which file from the list you'd like to run the optimizer on.

## Project Structure

- `main.cs` - Debug main.
- `PSO.cs` - Main particle swarm algorithm to get optimized racelines.
- `Particle.cs` - Represents particles for PSO.
- `EdgeDataImporter.cs` - Imports .bin files.
- `TrackSampler.cs` - Samples track into less segments to speed up algorithm.
- `RacelineExporter.cs` - Creates a new .bin file that contains the race track with the raceline.
- `CornerDetector.cs` - Detects corners on track boundaries and stores them.
- `RacelineVisualizer.cs` - Exports raceline on top of track to image (For visualization)
- `SavitzkyGolayFilter.cs` - Smooths the racing line.
- `./Input` - Folder for .bin files that needs to be processed.
- `./Output` - Export directory.

## Notes

- For additional commands, see the [official .NET CLI documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/).
- This is starting to optimize race lines properly. It just needs some minor tuning.
