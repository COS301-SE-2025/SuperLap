Hey Amber! Sean tells me you are looking for some coding stuff to do. I have an issue with the points that get extracted from the image processing. Since they are now just the pixel coordinates, the lines are very jagged as you can see in this screenshot. We can fix this with some smoothing functions, but I will be focusing on the RL for now, so if you would like to have a crack at it lemme know
